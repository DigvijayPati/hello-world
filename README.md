## Hello world

Get started:

`autoreconf --install`
`cd build`
`../configure`
`make`
`sudo make install`
`autoconf_hello_world`
`sudo make uninstall`

## What to gitignore on a real project

In normal projects, the files generated by the autoreconf --install command are also checked in with Git.

We .gitignore them here for minimality.
Configure
Installation prefix

`../configure --prefix="$(pwd)/install"`

will install all files in the install directory.

This is:

    very instructive to see what is getting built on large projects
    useful to prepare chroot environments
